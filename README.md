# Boston House Pricing Prediction

This project focuses on predicting Boston housing prices using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques in Python. Here I acted as a Data Scientist with a housing agency in Boston MA, and had been given access to a previous dataset on housing prices derived from the U.S. Census Service to present insights to higher management. Using the appropriate graphs and charts, I generated basic statistics and visualizations that I thought will be useful for the upper management to give them important insights.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the median value of owner-occupied homes in the Boston metropolitan area based on various features.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the *Boston Housing Dataset*, which is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains information about housing values in suburbs of Boston, along with various demographic and socio-economic factors.

The following describes the dataset variables:

* *CRIM:* Per capita crime rate by town
* *ZN:* Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
* *INDUS:* Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
* *CHAS:* Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
* *NOX:* Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
* *RM:* Average number of rooms per dwelling
* *AGE:* Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
* *DIS:* Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
* *RAD:* Index of accessibility to radial highways
* *TAX:* Full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000
* *PTRATIO:* Pupil-teacher ratio by town
* *B:* $1000(Bk - 0.63)^2$ where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
* *LSTAT:* Percentage lower status of the population
* *MEDV:* Median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000's (*Target Variable*)

The dataset used is uploaded in the repository titled 'boston.csv'.

## Insights in Boston real estate - Statistical analysis:
* Home prices v.s. various features.
* Descriptive Statistics - Statistical Analysis - Tests.
* Levene Test (Variances), T-test, ANOVA, Pearson Correlation, Regression analysis.

## Libraries Used

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* *pandas:* For data manipulation and analysis.
* *numpy:* For numerical computations.
* *scikit-learn (sklearn):* For accessing the dataset, data splitting, model implementation, and evaluation metrics.
* *matplotlib and seaborn:* For data visualization.
* *statsmodels:* For statistical modeling and analysis (potentially used for more traditional statistical approaches).

## Course Information  
This project was completed as part of the *Statistics for Data Science with Python* course on Coursera.
